# Healthcare Database Project

This project involves analyzing data from a healthcare database. The data is organized into 4 tables, and various SQL queries were used to extract meaningful insights. The queries were written using PostgreSQL. Below is an overview of the database schema, followed by the specific questions addressed in the project.

## Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:

**1. Patients-** patient_id, first_name, last_name, gender, birth_date, city, province_id, allergies, height, weight

**2. Admissions-** patient_id, admission_date, discharge_date, diagnosis, attending_doctor_id

**3. Doctors-** doctor_id, first_name, last_name, specialty

**4. Province Names-** province_id, province_name
